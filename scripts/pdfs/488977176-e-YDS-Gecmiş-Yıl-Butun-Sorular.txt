psychology is?

Student:
- It focuses on people's emotions, perceptions,
and thoughts. It's also concerned with the
consistency and change in an individual's
behaviour.

Professor:
- -----

Student:
- Even so, most people think of psychology as a
field that particularly studies how we behave in
certain situations.

A) It's very important to recognise the relevance of
basic concepts and principles of psychology to real-
life situations.

B) I certainly agree that studying psychology helps
us a lot to better understand others' feelings and
behaviours.

C) So you mean psychologists often limit
themselves to the study of outward, observable
behaviour.

D) It deals with not just what people think or feel,
but it also studies our mental processes,
personality traits, dreaming and motivation.

E) It has many subfields such as educational
psychology, but most people think that it focuses
solely on human behaviour.

16. The successful synthesis of art and science
requires a careful study of the world around us,
but also a careful study of the world within us.

A) For a successful mixture of art and science, it is
essential for us to analyze our environment
more carefully than our emotions.

B) In order to combine art and science successfully,
we need to look into either our inside or outside
world very carefully.

C) Blending art and science successfully
necessitates a thorough inspection of our outer
world as well as our inner world.

D) A close examination of our surroundings may be
just as important to our psychology if we want to
unite art and science in a successful way.

E) When it comes to synthesizing art and science
successfully, we can do nothing but investigate
our inner and outer world.

credited with the idea of continental drift, there
were others who proposed the same idea even
earlier.

A) The idea of continental drift is attributed to
German scientist Alfred Wegener, while there
were others who previously claimed the same idea.

B) Among those who put forward the idea of
continental drift, German scientist Alfred Wegener
was the first to suggest it.

C) Prior to German scientist Alfred Wegener, who
claimed the idea of continental drift, there were
not any other scientists who suggested the same
idea.

D) It was not until German scientist Alfred
Wegener proved the idea of continental drift that
it began to be supported by others.

E) The idea of continental drift could not be
accepted before German scientist Alfred Wegener,
even though there were others offering the same
idea earlier than him.

35. Humans have been adorning and modifying
their bodies for thousands of years. People from
all cultures around the world have made efforts
to change their bodies in different ways in an
attempt to meet their standards of beauty as well
as their religious or social obligations. ---- Scholars
who have studied the ways in which humans
mark their bodies note that bodily displays create,
communicate, and maintain individuality and
distinctiveness. Today, tattooing, piercing, and
other forms of permanent and temporary body
modification are seen by many as visible markers
of self-expression.

A) Extreme modifications such as heavy tattooing
and multiple piercings might be seen as
outrageous and criticised by others.

B) On the other hand, human bodies are never
unmarked, even when not explicitly marked
through adornment, because bodies can be fat or
thin, male or female, and young or old.

C) However, body painting has probably been
practised since the Palaeolithic Era as
archaeological evidence indicates.

D) In addition, people modify and adorn their
bodies as part of the complex process of creating
their personal identities.

E) Adornments such as jewellery have been found
in the earliest human graves, and bodies
unearthed from 5,000 years ago show signs of
intentional head shaping.

and lemon juice as food additives causes problems
in large-scale manufacturing situations. (II)
Consumer demand for manufactured food that has
a high uniform quality with a long shelf life and
that is as close to the natural state as possible has
been the major determinant for an increase in the
use of additives. (III) First, the desired active
ingredients in natural products are not consistent
in quality, properties, or concentration in their
natural state. (IV) Furthermore, they may bring
both undesirable flavour attributes, associated
with their source, to the finished product, and
microbiological contamination. (V) For example,
using orange or lemon juice to acidify a food
inevitably brings the flavour of oranges or lemons,
which may not be desired in the finished product.
