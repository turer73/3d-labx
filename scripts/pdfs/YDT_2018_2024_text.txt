İSTİKLÂL MARŞI
Korkma, sönmez bu şafaklarda yüzen al sancak; Bastığın yerleri toprak diyerek geçme, tanı:
Sönmeden yurdumun üstünde tüten en son ocak. Düşün altındaki binlerce kefensiz yatanı.
O benim milletimin yıldızıdır, parlayacak; Sen şehit oğlusun, incitme, yazıktır, atanı:
O benimdir, o benim milletimindir ancak. Verme, dünyaları alsan da bu cennet vatanı.
Çatma, kurban olayım, çehreni ey nazlı hilâl! Kim bu cennet vatanın uğruna olmaz ki feda?
Kahraman ırkıma bir gül! Ne bu şiddet, bu celâl? Şüheda fışkıracak toprağı sıksan, şüheda!
Sana olmaz dökülen kanlarımız sonra helâl. Cânı, cânânı, bütün varımı alsın da Huda,
Hakkıdır Hakk’a tapan milletimin istiklâl. Etmesin tek vatanımdan beni dünyada cüda.
Ben ezelden beridir hür yaşadım, hür yaşarım. Ruhumun senden İlâhî, şudur ancak emeli:
Hangi çılgın bana zincir vuracakmış? Şaşarım! Değmesin mabedimin göğsüne nâmahrem eli.
Kükremiş sel gibiyim, bendimi çiğner, aşarım. Bu ezanlar -ki şehadetleri dinin temeli-
Yırtarım dağları, enginlere sığmam, taşarım. Ebedî yurdumun üstünde benim inlemeli.
Garbın âfâkını sarmışsa çelik zırhlı duvar, O zaman vecd ile bin secde eder -varsa- taşım,
Benim iman dolu göğsüm gibi serhaddim var. Her cerîhamdan İlâhî, boşanıp kanlı yaşım,
Ulusun, korkma! Nasıl böyle bir imanı boğar, Fışkırır ruh-ı mücerret gibi yerden na’şım;
Medeniyyet dediğin tek dişi kalmış canavar? O zaman yükselerek arşa değer belki başım.
Arkadaş, yurduma alçakları uğratma sakın; Dalgalan sen de şafaklar gibi ey şanlı hilâl!
Siper et gövdeni, dursun bu hayâsızca akın. Olsun artık dökülen kanlarımın hepsi helâl.
Doğacaktır sana va’dettiği günler Hakk’ın; Ebediyyen sana yok, ırkıma yok izmihlâl;
Kim bilir, belki yarın, belki yarından da yakın. Hakkıdır hür yaşamış bayrağımın hürriyyet;
Hakkıdır Hakk’a tapan milletimin istiklâl!
Mehmet Âkif ERSOY

GENÇLİĞE HİTABE
Ey Türk gençliği! Birinci vazifen, Türk istiklâlini, Türk Cumhuriyetini,
ilelebet muhafaza ve müdafaa etmektir.
Mevcudiyetinin ve istikbalinin yegâne temeli budur. Bu temel,
senin en kıymetli hazinendir. İstikbalde dahi, seni bu hazineden mahrum
etmek isteyecek dâhilî ve hâricî bedhahların olacaktır. Bir gün, istiklâl
ve cumhuriyeti müdafaa mecburiyetine düşersen, vazifeye atılmak için,
içinde bulunacağın vaziyetin imkân ve şeraitini düşünmeyeceksin! Bu
imkân ve şerait, çok namüsait bir mahiyette tezahür edebilir. İstiklâl ve
cumhuriyetine kastedecek düşmanlar, bütün dünyada emsali görülmemiş
bir galibiyetin mümessili olabilirler. Cebren ve hile ile aziz vatanın bütün
kaleleri zapt edilmiş, bütün tersanelerine girilmiş, bütün orduları dağıtılmış
ve memleketin her köşesi bilfiil işgal edilmiş olabilir. Bütün bu şeraitten
daha elîm ve daha vahim olmak üzere, memleketin dâhilinde iktidara sahip
olanlar gaflet ve dalâlet ve hattâ hıyanet içinde bulunabilirler. Hattâ bu
iktidar sahipleri şahsî menfaatlerini, müstevlîlerin siyasî emelleriyle tevhit
edebilirler. Millet, fakr u zaruret içinde harap ve bîtap düşmüş olabilir.
Ey Türk istikbalinin evlâdı! İşte, bu ahval ve şerait içinde dahi
vazifen, Türk istiklâl ve cumhuriyetini kurtarmaktır. Muhtaç olduğun kudret,
damarlarındaki asil kanda mevcuttur.
Mustafa Kemal Atatürk

Pozzolanic mortars were so strong and cheap, and
